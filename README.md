**A comprehensive guide to writing Rust applications**

## What is this book about?
Rust is a highly concurrent and high performance language that focuses on safety and speed, memory management, and writing clean code. It also guarantees thread safety, and its aim is to improve the performance of existing applications. Its potential is shown by the fact that it has been backed by Mozilla to solve the critical problem of concurrency.

This book covers the following exciting features:
* Set up Rust for Windows, Linux, and OS X
* Write effective code using Rust
* Expand your Rust applications using libraries
* Interface existing non-Rust libraries with your Rust applications
* Use the standard library within your applications
* Understand memory management within Rust and speed efficiency when passing variables
* Create more complex data types
* Study concurrency in Rust with multi-threaded applications and sync threading techniques to improve the performance of an application problem
