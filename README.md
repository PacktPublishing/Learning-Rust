# ASP.NET Core 2 High Performance - Second Edition
This is the code repository for [ASP.NET Core 2 High Performance - Second Edition](https://www.packtpub.com/application-development/aspnet-core-2-high-performance-second-edition?utm_source=github&utm_medium=repository&utm_campaign=9781788399760), published by [Packt](https://www.packtpub.com/?utm_source=github). It contains all the supporting project files necessary to work through the book from start to finish.
## About the Book
The ASP.NET Core 2 framework is used to develop high-performance, cross-platform web applications, and is built on .NET Core 2, allowing the use of more .NET Framework APIs.

This book will address high-level performance improvement techniques. We start by locating and measuring problems, along with solving some of the most common ones. Next, we deploy an application to a production network and tolerate latency. We then learn to optimize C# code and choose the best data structures for the job. We also cover parallel programming and distributed architectures.

By the end of this book, you will be fixing latency issues and optimizing performance problems, but you will also know how this affects the complexity of the application. As a parting note, you will explore a few highly advanced techniques for further optimization.

This book assumes that the reader can already build a web application, and so does not cover this. However, it does show how to get started with ASP.NET Core 2 on Windows, Mac, Linux, and Docker.

## Instructions and Navigation
All of the code is organized into folders. Each folder starts with a number followed by the application name. For example, Chapter02.

There are no code files for chapters 1, 2, 3, 6, 9, and 12 do not have any code files.

The code will look like the following:
```
#import packages into the project
from bs4 import BeautifulSoup
from urllib.request import urlopen
import pandas as pd
```

You will need a development environment to follow the code examples in this bookâ€”Visual Studio 2017, Visual Studio Mac, or VS Code. You could also use your text editor of choice and the dotnet command-line tool. If you're using Visual Studio, then you should still install the latest .NET Core SDK to enable the tooling. 
For some of the chapters, you will also need SQL Server 2016, although you could use 2017. However, you could also use Azure and run against a cloud database.
There are other tools that we will cover, but we will introduce these as they are used. The detailed software/hardware list is available along with the code files.
